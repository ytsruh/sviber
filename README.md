# Sviber

A skeleton template using Sveltekit on the the frontend & Fiber on the backend. Sviber is based around the ideas of minimalism & simplicity.

## Fiber

A Go framework for building API's. Fiber offers an ExpressJS inspired way to build API's and servers. Fiber is configured to serve a built Svelkit app

## Sveltekit

A Svelte framework for building UI's. Sveltekit is set up to deliver a Single Page Application (SPA) so that it can be easily built & exported to be served. Server routes will not function and cannot be used within this template.
